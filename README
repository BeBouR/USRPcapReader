Useless Small Ruby Pcap Reader

Reads a Pcap file passed through command line and prints unix time and size of each packet in the file in JSON, YAML or XML format.

It's getting more and more customizable:

- Choose what data to output (kind of lacking in this by now)
- Discard packets depending on type
- Sort results
- Choose output format
- All settings are in one file.
- You can have multiple configuration files and choose which one to use by passing it as command line argument

Tested on Ruby 1.9.3p0

Requires ruby-pcap:
