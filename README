Useless Small Ruby Pcap Reader

Reads a Pcap file passed through command line and prints unix time and size of each packet in the file in JSON, YAML or XML format.

It's getting more and more customizable:

- Choose what data to output
    - General data
    - IP data
    - TODO: TCP
    - TODO: UDP
- Discard packets depending on type
- Sort results
- Choose output format
- All settings are in one file.
- You can have multiple configuration files and choose which one to use by passing it as command line argument


TODO:
Access to TCP and UDP data fields,
Access to RawData and IPData, maybe (it's half binary, half text, it throws encoding errors)

Tested on Ruby 1.9.3p0

Requires ruby-pcap:
